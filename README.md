## A simple repro of oazapfts behavior compared to other generators

### Initial setup

```shell
yarn install
yarn gen:all
```

Although this doesn't solve anything, I plan on writing type tests + linking oazapfts and patching that. If that doesn't seem too feasbile, we'll need to explore alternative solutions for the RTK Query code generator.
